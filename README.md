# Papyrus
Papyrus is a tool to render Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (from now on referenced as "MCBE") worlds using Leaflet.
Since MCBE worlds don't use the Anvil format like in the Java Edition, but rather a by Mojang modified version of Google's LevelDB to save, Papyrus can read the world and assemble render of the every pre-generated chunk.
